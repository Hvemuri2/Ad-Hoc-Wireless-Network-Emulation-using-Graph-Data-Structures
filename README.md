# Ad-Hoc-Wireless-Network-Emulation-using-Graph-Data-Structures
This project involved the creation of an ad hoc wireless network emulation as an implementation of the graph data structure, using the adjacency list model in Java. This wireless network is designed as a graph where each wireless device is a vertex, and adjacent nodes (devices) are connected using weighted edges. This network can be visualized on a grid with x-y axis and the Euclidean distance between adjacent nodes is used as weight for the edges. It also included functionalities like navigation to find the shortest path from one node in the network to the other, which I achieved through the implementation of Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm. Overall, this project served to practice principles of DSA in java.
